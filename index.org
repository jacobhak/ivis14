Information Visualization project 1

* Numbers
  I used Numbers (Apple's version of spreadsheets) extensively.  A
  large chunk of the work went into building different tables and
  battling with the charting system.

  I built groups based on the skills and interests of the subjects and
  weighed in their interests. The sheet with the results is called "Grouping"
  
* Splunk Search
  I used a [[http://splunk.com][Splunk]] search to find out a bit more about the people that
  had listed two of the most popular hobbies/interests, Programming
  and Music. I found that subjects 3, 14 and 15 had these two
  interests in common. They may be an excellent group (disregarding
  their skills).

  The Search results are [[here(pdf)][]]
